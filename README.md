# Northwestern Atlantic ocean microbial community difference in small and large size fractions characterised through amplicon sequence

We determined the difference in community diversity between two size fractions of water samples from a single site, and the possbility of merging two size fractions to a comparable unit to samples that were not size fractionated.
